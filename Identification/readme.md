-The multiplexed_16S_FISH_probe_data.csv contains the probe p1-p6 intensities obtained from the segmented cells.

-The multiplexed_FISH_decoding.py script converts the probe intensity data to a binary signal and assigns them to a species.

-The image dataset is openly available at Zenodo in the following doi: 10.5281/zenodo.13287507
