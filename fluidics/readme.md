-This is how the system was connected: 
![The ACBC fluidic setup](images/S6.png)

Operation:
-Briefly, a sample syringe pump is used to flow the bacterial sample through the device under capturing conditions (in the study a Harvard11 syringe pump was used for this task but any of the custom-made syringe pumps can be used for this task as well).

-Once done with trapping bacteria, a 3way-valve is used to engage the chip with a selection valve containing the FISH reagents. 

-Each reagent is finally delivered through one of the custom syringe pumps.

-Each task can be conducted through the GUI in acbc_multi.py
